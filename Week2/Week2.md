# WEEK 2
## Troubleshooting and Repairing a 3D Printer

Today, we started fixing the 3D printer by receiving a new Stepper motor. During our examination from the previous day, we found out that the extruder's stepper motor was not working. Therefore, we disassembled the entire mechanism and changed the faulty motor with the new one. To ensure we could reassemble the printer the way it was, we took pictures while disassembling it. It took us some time to figure out a way to reassemble the printer. After we fixed the initial issue, we tried a test print by following the instructions and setting the printer to collaboration mode. However, we ran into another issue where the stepper motor did not feed into the filament. A potential reason for this could be that the new motor had a different pinout compared to the old one.

Our troubleshooting began with examining the wiring and pin arrangements of the new motor. After some investigation, we determined that the pinouts were identical, eliminating one possible cause of the issue. Next, we investigated the extruder component and realized that it was fastened too tightly, which prevented the motor from rotating and impeded proper extruder feeding. We rectified this problem and made another attempt at a test print, but it was still unsuccessful. We noticed that the nozzle was shaking excessively, causing the print to be unstable. Upon examining the nozzle, we discovered that it was not correctly positioned and was heavily soiled with the melted filament, prompting us to replace it with a new one. We took several pictures and videos of the wire connection before removing the old nozzle to ensure proper reinstallation of the new one. Finally, we installed the new nozzle correctly this time. The printer was working well after fixing the issue. We successfully repaired the printer with our knowledge and with the help of Mr Daniele. We started printing the Air Fan Adapter.

## Organized An Event

We assisted the team in preparing the Lab for an event by ensuring that the machines were displayed properly for the guests. On the following day, we participated in the event. The event was to showcase the progress of the projects, which went pretty succesful and afterwards, we rearranged the Lab for regular use.

## Soldering SMD Components

The day started with a general team meeting called the jour fix. The meeting is supposed to know the progress of every individual with their tasks. We explained our performance and got some new tasks for the week. The tasks included soldering 4 PCBs , training for the laser cutter machine, vinyl cutter B.O.M, download fusion with university (training). We started with our 1st task of soldering. The task was to solder 4 PCBs, 2 for a laser machine and 2 for a CNC machine. We acquired the skill of manually soldering SMD components without using solder paste or an oven, which was challenging at first but became easier with practice. We managed to complete the 2 PCBs required for the CNC machine, and we plan to work on the other 2 next week.

## Learnings from University

This week we used the skills and knowledge of soldering components(THT) from the practical electronics course. we were taught about the steps involved during soldering components, which we used while soldering the components on the PCBs.
