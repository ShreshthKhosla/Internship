# Week 6

## Masks to help drill holes

We had to laser cut few masks to help drill the hole on the aluminium profile for the kit of fabulaser machine. The material we used was polypropylene, for which we had to change the laser settings on Visicut. The settings were modified so that the material doesnt catch fire. After chnaging the sttings, the masks were fabricated.

## Prepared B.O.M.

We made BOM for Large laser, Vinyl cutter and CNC milling machine. For the BOM, we had to download a plug-in called as properties++ which helps to produce the BOM.


## Designed Steper Motor Driver

We made a stepper motor driver design by taking dimensions from real life model. we used vernier Calliper to measure the dimensions and also used the datasheet from online to create an accurate drawing.

## Drilled and tapped holes 

We had to drill and tap holes on the aluminuim profiles for the kit of fabulaser mini machine. This kit will be used for the workshop in Tunisia.

## Repaired a CNC machine vice

There was some isssue with the milling vice. The screw of the vice was bent, so we had to open the vice first and then remove the screw. The opening of the vice was hard as it had rust and it was old. To lubricate the holes and the vice, we used WD-40 which is a penetrant and a lubricant. We applied the solution and left it for 30 minutes. Finally, we opened the vice and removed the screw. 

## Tested the kit for fabulaser mini

We had to assemble the entire fabulaser kit which will be used for a workshop in tunisia. The testing consisted of checking the body of the machine, electronics and the cables. We assembled the machine with the help of the 3D CAD of the machine. The task was long and took us 2 days to completely assemble the machine. We found multiple problems while assembling and wrote those problems in notes.
