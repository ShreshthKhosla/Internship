# WEEK 8

## Designed Air gun Holder


At the beginning of the week, we created a holder for an air gun that would be used with one of the milling machines. The design was made using Fusion 360, and we took measurements from the machine. Once we had the first version, we made some adjustments to the design.
Using a Prusa Slicer, we 3D printed the part and affixed it with double-sided tape. 
Unfortunately, the part did not meet our expectations and needed some modifications as it would not stay on the machine. So, we created a new, smaller and more easily accessible design. After printing it out again using the 3D printer, we affixed it with double-sided tape.

## Laser Cut 
We laser-cut four acrylic parts to help align the profiles for milling in the small CNC machine.

## CrowdFunding

We conducted research on various crowdfunding platforms to identify one that would be appropriate for a potential future campaign. Our research focused on the purpose of the websites and their associated fees. Ultimately, we discovered a website that is tailored to open-source hardware, aligning with our company's vision.
Additionally, we analyzed the different types of campaigns and the average funding amounts raised through crowdfunding

## Machine Disassembly

Once we had assembled the machine, we proceeded to address any mechanical issues it may have had. Once we resolved these issues, we then carefully disassembled the machine and organized all the parts in accordance with the list.
