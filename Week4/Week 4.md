# WEEK 4
## Completed Task on Fusion 360

The week began with the completion of the previous task of puttting fasteners into the laser cutting machine in Fusion 360. It was a time taking proceess, as we had to disassemble the outer body of the machine to check the screw and their measurements.

## PCB testing for the CNC laser cutting machine

Our initial task involved testing the laser-cut PCB that we had soldered in the previous week. We had to remove the old PCB from the machine and replace it with the one we were testing. To ensure that we could do this without any issues, we took pictures of the connections. However, when we attempted to turn on the machine after changing the boards, there was a short circuit. We had mistakenly made an extra connection on the power supply voltage that was not necessary for the newer version of the PCB. We proceeded to check the soldering and continuity using a multimeter, but the machine still did not work.

Eventually, we discovered that the teensy development board and the attiny microcontroller had not been flashed. After flashing them, we calibrated the machine, and it began to work. We repeated this process for the other PCB.

## Designing Stepper Motor on Fusion 360

The task was to make a stepper motor on Fusion 360 by taking dimensions from the motor and its datasheet itself. I used vernier calliper to measure the dimensions of the motor. The experience of using Fusion was very similar to using SOLIDWORKS.

## PCB testing for CNC Milling machine 

Our objective was to test the CNC milling PCBs that we had soldered the previous week. These PCBs were designed to control the motor through a motor controller. Specifically, they enabled the motor to move in the x, y, and z directions, while also utilizing an inductive probe to stop the motor at its end limits. To begin testing, we made the required connections and successfully observed the motor moving.

## Cutting wood to organize waste

As we had an easter weekend, we had to organize the waste and cut the woods. We were given a short safety lesson on how to use the machines. We had an automatic hand saw machine and a bench saw machine. We completed the task and cleaned the area.
