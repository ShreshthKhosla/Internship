# WEEK 1
##  Introduction to Organization    

The day commenced with gaining more knowledge about the workplace, the office, and the objectives of the organization. While exploring the lab, we were provided with an overview of the in-house machines created by the team and the projects they were working on. 

##  Constructing and Calibrating a Prusa Slicer Mini+ 3D Printer
Afterwards, our initial assignment was to construct a Prusa Slicer Mini+ following the instructions provided in the manual. The printer will be used for the labs for future use. After assembling the 3D printer, we fine-tuned it by calibrating and testing it with a small design created on SOLIDWORKS and rendered on Prusa Slicer. The test piece produced was flawed due to a problem with the nozzle height, which was rectified by adjusting the probe through referencing the distance between the probe and nozzle. Following this, we printed an Air fan Adapter on the 3D printer. The purpose of the Air fan is to accessorize the laser cutter machine. The 3D printed adapter will be used to fit the exhaust pipe of the laser cutter machine.

##  Fixing the Anycubic Predator 3D printer  
The following task was to fix a 3D printer that was experiencing issues with shifting while printing. We researched online and found six potential causes, one of which was an abnormal stepper motor. We examined all the stepper motors using multimeter (pins: 1&3 and 4&6) and found that three out of four were functioning properly, but one was not. We removed the potentially faulty motor and took multiple photos and videos to avoid confusion later. Unfortunately, we were unable to fully repair it as the company did not have a spare stepper motor of that specific size, and using a different size could result in torque problems.

## Introduction to cables and ways of crimping
Next, we progressed to the topic of cable varieties and crimping methods. We acquainted ourselves with diverse cable types, the proper technique for removing the insulation, and the suitable crimpers to use. After grasping the fundamentals, we commenced our assignment, which involved producing wires with specific measurements for various purposes, like stepper motors with 4x0.5mm cables that were 150mm long. Once we chose the cable and cut it to the required length, we had to solder it to the corresponding component. Subsequently, we learned about heat-shrinking tubes and applied them to the soldered section to prevent any contact between cables. These wires were designed for utilization in a laser cutting machine that would be marketed shortly. Additionally, we had to solder the motor cables and other cables.

## Learnings Used from HSRW

This week, I was able to utilize the knowledge gained from my study course in various tasks assigned to me. Since I had prior experience working with a Prusa Slicer Mini+ in the university, building the same printer was relatively straightforward. During the test printing process, we created a basic design using SOLIDWORKS, which was a skill we had acquired in our university course. 
When troubleshooting issues with the Anycubic Predator 3D printer, I was able to apply my university education by using a multimeter to check the pinouts of the stepper motor.
