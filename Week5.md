# WEEK5

## Completed testing CNC milling PCB

We proceeded to complete the remaining task of testing the PCB. In the previous week, we assessed the motion of the motor in the x, y, and z directions. Our objective was to examine the end limits using the inductive probe. In order to connect the probe to the PCB, we needed to solder a 3 pin connector wire with the probe. Once the connections were made, we tested all of the axes, but only the x axis was functioning properly. We deduced that the y and z axes were likely malfunctioning due to a faulty connection or blown SMD component, most likely the transistor in this case. We identified that the z axis problem was caused by a poorly soldered transistor, which was rectified, resulting in its proper functionality. Additionally, the y axis had an imperfect connection that was resolved. Subsequently, we confirmed that the PCB was operating as expected. A similar assessment was carried out for the other PCB.

## Designing a testing plate on Fusion 360

We were asked to design 3 plates which was used for the testing of three stepper motors. The function of the plate was to hold the motor and an aluminum profile rod together. The design didnt take long, but we had to rectify the design twice to make it sturdy as we were using plywood. Later, we laser cut it using the laser duo machine.

## Motor testing

Following the fabrication of the plates, we proceeded to assemble the motor and the aluminum profile together with the plate. In order to verify the motor's accuracy, we connected it to the motor driver (including the Encoder, Control signal, and VCC-GND) using the same method as we did during the PCB testing. Once we confirmed that the motor was functional through UGS software, our next step was to assess its accuracy and that of the PCB board. To do so, we utilized an online tool called Rep Rap calculator to determine the appropriate step per mm value, which we inputted into both UGS and the motor driver. After testing multiple values, we found that 128 steps per mm was the optimal value.

Given that the desired outcome is a precise and accurate cylindrical positioning system, we conducted thorough testing of the motor. This system is intended for sale to the University of Duisburg Essen.

## Tapping Aluminum Rod

We tapped the aluminum rods using an electrical tapping machine. The process was simple, we need to place the right sized tapping bit, in our case it was M5, and apply some lubricant on the rod and then do the tapping clockwise and anti clockwise. We had to do two rods of the same kind.

## Organized Aluminum pieces

We had to help in organizing the aluminum sheets that were there in the lab. We had to cut the unwanted part from the sheet and keep the useful pieces in a box. We used the band saw machine which we also used for cutting the wood.
